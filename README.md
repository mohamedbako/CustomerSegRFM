# CustomerSegRFM
RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, each corresponding to some key customer trait. These RFM metrics are important indicators of a customer’s behavior because frequency and monetary value affects a customer’s lifetime value, and recency affects retention, a measure of engagement.
## RFM analysis helps marketers find answers to the following questions:

- Who are your best customers?
- Which of your customers could contribute to your churn rate?
- Who has the potential to become valuable customers?
- Which of your customers can be retained?
- Which of your customers are most likely to respond to engagement campaigns?
